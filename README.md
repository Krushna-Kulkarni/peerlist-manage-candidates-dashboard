## Demo - [See Live](https://peerlist-recruiter-dashboard.vercel.app/)

## Docs
Features - 
- Pixel Perfect UI resembling current peerlist production UI.
- Drag and drop kanban board - 100% responsive for all devices.
- Card (application) data manipulation when a card is dropped across sections. ('Applied xd ago' is right now set in a way that it always shows 1d ago - but it's not hard coded ')
- Application status history - Card  'Shortlisted' or 'Rejected' or moved back to 'Applied' is recorded with recruiter profile and timestamp. (Again, is not hardcoded to current date')
- Fully functional candidate search. on search - shows cards in their respective sections.

Modifications in design for consistency -
- When card is in 'Shortlisted' or 'Rejected' in both cases 'Experience , Holding Offer ? Notice Period' are shown. and contact is dynamic - can be shown if available - run hidden.
- Sidebar icons font in design is set to 14px but in the production website it was 24px - so made it 24px - looked better.

In progress -
- Collapsible sections feature is in progress but for now not completed.
